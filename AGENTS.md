### Package manager

this project is configured with bun and uv.
instead of `npm` --> Use `bun` for node packages and to run js,ts script files. eg. bun run test.ts
Instead of `pip` --> Use `uv` for python packages. use `uv add <package>` to install packages directly, `uv run` to run files directly (no venv setup needed, uv handles it automatically).

### Running Script Files

Always use `bun run` to execute TypeScript scripts:
And `uv run` to execute python script files
example:

```bash
bun run src/x/test-normalize.ts

uv run src/x/test-normalize.py
```

### Scripts

Create script files in `manager/tools` folder in the root only, (never in other place).
Make sure to give the file a good name for later understanding its use, use `_` instead of spaces while naming the files.
Delete the unnecessary script files you have created after the task is complete.
