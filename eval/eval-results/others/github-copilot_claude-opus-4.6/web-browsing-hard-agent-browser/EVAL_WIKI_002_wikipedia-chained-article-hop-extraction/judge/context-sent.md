He was the original author of Turbo Pascal and the chief architect of Delphi. He currently works for Microsoft as the lead architect of C#[1] and core developer on TypeScript.[3]\n\n---\nHejlsberg was born in Copenhagen, Denmark,[4] and studied Electrical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. While at the university in 1980, he began writing programs for the Nascom microcomputer, including a Pascal compiler which was initially marketed as the Blue Label Software Pascal for the Nascom-2. However, he soon rewrote it for CP/M and DOS, marketing it first as Compas Pascal and later as PolyPascal. Later the product was licensed to Borland, and integrated into an IDE to become the Turbo Pascal system. Turbo Pascal competed with PolyPascal. The compiler itself was largely inspired by the \"Tiny Pascal\" compiler in Niklaus Wirth's Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, one of the most influential computer science books of the time.[5]\n"

Screenshot saved to `eval-wikipedia-hop.png`. Here are the results:

```
FullName: Anders Hejlsberg
Nationality: Danish
PhDUniversity: Not listed
OtherProject: C#
```

**Notes:**

- The TypeScript Wikipedia page lists **Anders Hejlsberg** as the designer.
- His article identifies him as **Danish** (born in Copenhagen, Denmark).
- His education is listed as the **Technical University of Denmark**, but it was for studying Electrical Engineering -- no PhD is mentioned, only that he "studied" there. Hence "Not listed" for PhD.
- He is credited with co-designing several notable projects: **Turbo Pascal**, **Delphi**, and **C#**. I listed C# as the other notable project since he is the lead architect.
