Despite my best efforts, I find myself getting sucked into shorts, so I&#x27;m starting investigate if I can take advantage of YouTube RSS syndication. I recently build yt-dlp and got all the dependencies sorted out, so I can bring videos to my machine locally. I&#x27;m also checking out elfeed[0] which is an Emacs based RSS reader, and elfeed-tube[1] which further customizes the elfeed experience for YouTube as well as adding an mpv integration that lets you control video playback directly from Emacs.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skeeto&#x2F;elfeed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skeeto&#x2F;elfeed</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karthink&#x2F;elfeed-tube\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;karthink&#x2F;elfeed-tube</a>","time":1773420794,"type":"comment"}
