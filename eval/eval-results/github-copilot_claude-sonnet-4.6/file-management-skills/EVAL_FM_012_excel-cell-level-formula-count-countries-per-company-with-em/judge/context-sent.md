Now I understand the structure. Let me map it out:

- **Table-1 (rows 1–??)**: Country list in column A (A1 = "Country", A2 = "B", A3 = "F") — but rows 4–10 may be empty. This is the countries table.
- **Table-2 (rows 11–13)**: Company employees per country. Row 11 is the header. Columns B–H correspond to countries A–G. Row 12 = ABC, Row 13 = EFG. Column I = "No of countries".

The columns B through H (columns 2–8) represent countries A through G. The formula for I12/I13 should count how many of those values (B12:H12 or B13:H13) are `>0`.

The correct formula is `=COUNTIF(B12:H12,">0")` for I12, and `=COUNTIF(B13:H13,">0")` for I13.

Let me also check if Table-1 column A has a specific range used (A1:A??) that should be referenced instead.

Looking at the data:

- A1 = "Country" (header), A2 = "B", A3 = "F" — so Table-1 countries are in A2:A?
- The employee data columns B–H correspond to countries A–G (7 countries total)
- ABC has values: B=2, C=4, D=3, E=1, F=0(empty), G=1, H=0(empty) → 5 countries with >0 employees
- EFG has values: B=0, C=1, D=0, E=1, F=0, G=1, H=0 → 3 countries with >0 employees

LibreOffice recalc doesn't work on Windows. Let me manually calculate the values to verify correctness.

The workbook has been updated and saved. Here are the results:

---

**Workbook structure:**

- **Table-1** (rows 1–10): Country list in column A (header "Country", then countries A–G across columns B–H in Table-2 header row)
- **Table-2** (rows 11–13): Companies × Countries employee matrix. Row 11 = headers, Row 12 = ABC, Row 13 = EFG. Column I = "No of countries"

**Logic:** `COUNTIF` counts how many of the 7 country columns (B–H) have a value `>0` for each company row.

**ABC (row 12) data:** B=2, C=4, D=3, E=1, F=0, G=1, H=0 → 5 countries with employees  
**EFG (row 13) data:** B=0, C=1, D=0, E=1, F=0, G=1, H=0 → 3 countries with employees

---

FormulaApplied: `=COUNTIF(B12:H12,">0")` (same pattern applied to row 13 as `=COUNTIF(B13:H13,">0")`)  
ValueI12: 5  
ValueI13: 3
