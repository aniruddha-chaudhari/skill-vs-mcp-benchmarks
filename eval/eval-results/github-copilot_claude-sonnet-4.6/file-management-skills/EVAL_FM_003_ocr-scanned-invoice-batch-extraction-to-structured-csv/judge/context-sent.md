All 5 images exist. Now let me read them and perform OCR using Python with pytesseract/PIL.

Let me first read the images to see what they look like, then run OCR:

I can now read all 5 invoices clearly. Let me extract the data and process everything.

## Assistant

Extracted data from all 5 images:

| #   | InvoiceNumber | Date       | VendorName        | TotalAmount |
| --- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | INV-2024-001  | 2024-01-15 | Acme Corp         | 1250.00     |
| 2   | INV-2024-002  | 2024-01-22 | TechSupply Inc    | 3450.75     |
| 3   | INV-2024-003  | 2024-02-03 | Office Depot      | 890.50      |
| 4   | INV-2024-004  | 2024-02-10 | Acme Corp         | 2100.00     |
| 5   | INV-2024-005  | 2024-02-18 | CloudServices LLC | 5500.00     |

Now creating the output directory and CSV:

Now computing the final answers:

- **Highest TotalAmount**: INV-2024-005 = $5500.00 (highest of all 5)
- **Duplicate Vendor**: `Acme Corp` appears in both INV-2024-001 and INV-2024-004 → **Yes**
- **Sum**: 1250.00 + 3450.75 + 890.50 + 2100.00 + 5500.00 = **13191.25**
- **CSV Row Count**: 5 data rows

**Extracted Data Summary** (`outputs/invoices_extracted.csv` written with 5 rows):

| InvoiceNumber | Date       | VendorName        | TotalAmount |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| INV-2024-001  | 2024-01-15 | Acme Corp         | 1250.00     |

| INV-2024-004  | 2024-02-10 | Acme Corp         | 2100.00     |
| INV-2024-005  | 2024-02-18 | CloudServices LLC | 5500.00     |

```
HighestAmountInvoice: INV-2024-005
DuplicateVendor: Yes
TotalSumAllInvoices: 13191.25
CSVRowCount: 5
```

**Notes:**

- `HighestAmountInvoice`: INV-2024-005 (CloudServices LLC, $5500.00)
- `DuplicateVendor`: Yes — "Acme Corp" appears in both INV-2024-001 and INV-2024-004
