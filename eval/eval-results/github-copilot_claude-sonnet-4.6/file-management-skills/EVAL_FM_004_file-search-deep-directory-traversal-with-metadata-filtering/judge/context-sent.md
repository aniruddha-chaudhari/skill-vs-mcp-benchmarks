Here are the findings:

**Analysis Summary:**

1. **Recent .py files (last 30 days):** All 10 `.py` files found — `backup.py`, `backup_copy.py`, `cleanup.py`, `deploy.py`, `app.py`, `config.py`, `utils.py`, `test_integration.py`, `test_app.py`, `test_utils.py`

2. **Largest file:** `uploads/project_files/data/raw/data.csv` at **519,693 bytes**

3. **Log files with ERROR:** `logs/2024/01/error.log` and `logs/2024/02/error.log` — **2 files**

4. **Duplicate pairs:** 3 groups of duplicates:
   - `backup.py` == `backup_copy.py` (1 pair)
   - `logs/2024/01/error.log` == `logs/2024/02/error.log` (1 pair)
   - `logs/2024/01/app.log`, `logs/2024/02/app.log`, `logs/2024/02/debug.log` (3 pairs from 3 identical files)
   - **Total: 5 pairs**

```

## Assistant

**Notes on duplicate pair counting:** The 3 `app.log`/`debug.log` files share the same MD5 hash (`f454108d8ad4922f1c20ac0869275120`), which yields 3 pairs from that group (C(3,2) = 3). Combined with the 2 other duplicate pairs, the total is **5 duplicate pairs**.
