Now I understand the structure clearly. Let me analyze the STAGE example to understand the logic:

- RANGES STAGE has entries with DATE and REF columns
- LISTS STAGE combines entries by DATE+REF (summing AMOUNTS for duplicates)
- Sorted by DATE ascending, then REF alphabetically A-Z
- TOTAL row at bottom

Let me write the transformation script:

## Assistant

Here are the results:

**What was done:**

- Parsed all three sections from the RANGES sheet (STAGE, DATA, OPERATION)
- Grouped entries by DATE + REF, summing AMOUNTS for duplicate combinations
- Sorted each section: primary sort by DATE ascending, secondary sort by REF A-Z
- Cleared the old placeholder data in LISTS and repopulated with aggregated rows
- Added a `=SUM(...)` TOTAL formula at the bottom of each section
- Matched the exact formatting from the completed STAGE reference (fonts, fills, alignment, date format)

**Verification:**

- STAGE: 11 raw rows → 7 aggregated rows, TOTAL = 1,860 (D10: `=SUM(D3:D9)`)
- DATA: 15 raw rows → 5 aggregated rows, TOTAL = 4,755 (D20: `=SUM(D15:D19)`)
- OPERATION: 19 raw rows → 7 aggregated rows, TOTAL = 6,495 (D32: `=SUM(D25:D31)`)
