I can see the comment thread. Now I have:

- Story: "XML Is a Cheap DSL"
- Points: 35
- Comments: 6 (shown on submission line)

Now I need to identify which top-level comment has the most direct replies. The thread is very new (only 6 comments total). Let me analyze the structure - the top-level comments visible are: `necovek`, `sgarland`, `exabrial`, `wild_pointer`, `dndn2`, `jgalt212`. I need to determine which has the most direct replies. Since the story just posted ~1 hour ago with only 6 comments and each appears to be a flat top-level comment, I need to check indentation to find replies. Let me use the HN API to get the full comment tree data.

The API confirms:

- Score: 36 points (updated from 35)
- Descendants: 6 (total comments)
- Kids (top-level comment IDs): `[47376221, 47376209, 47376187, 47376151, 47376127, 47376208]`

Now I need to check each top-level comment to see how many direct replies (kids) each has. Let me fetch each comment's data.

All 6 top-level comments have no `kids` field, meaning none has any direct replies yet. Since all top-level comments have 0 direct replies (they're all brand new, posted within the last ~15 minutes), there is a tie. In this case, the "highest-karma" top-level comment refers to the comment with the most upvotes/points. Since we can't see vote counts directly without being logged in, I'll use the ordering from the HN API (which lists comments in order of their ranking) — the first listed, `necovek` (47376221), is the highest-ranked top-level comment.

Now let me navigate back to the comment thread page and take the screenshot.

**Notes on methodology:**

- **#1 ranked story**: Rank 1 on the HN front page at time of access.
- **Points**: 37 (live score at time of screenshot; the API showed 36 a moment earlier — the page rendered 37).
- **TotalComments**: 6 (shown as "6 comments" on the submission line; `descendants: 6` confirmed via API).
- **TopCommentAuthor**: All 6 top-level comments had **0 direct replies** (none had a `kids` field in the HN API). With a tie on reply count, the top-level comment ranked first by HN's algorithm (highest position = highest karma/score among top-level comments) is `necovek`.
