I now have all the data needed. Let me also get the oldest release from the snapshot to confirm.

From the full page snapshot, I can identify:

1. **Latest stable release**: `2.32.5` — marked as "This version" (latest), no pre-release markers
2. **Latest stable release date**: `Aug 19, 2025` (shown in the header and history list)
3. **Oldest release**: `0.0.1` — the last entry at the bottom of the list (Feb 14, 2011)
4. **Total release count**: `157` — confirmed via JavaScript DOM query on `.release__version` elements

The screenshot has been saved to `eval-pypi-history.png`.

## Tool: playwright_browser_close (tooluse_zbtSCSijV3jzd1ffbSJoNq)

Output: ### Result
