I'll help you find the oldest open issue on the Express.js GitHub repository. Let me navigate there and find it.

The page is sorted by newest first. I need to sort by oldest to find the issue with the smallest number. Let me navigate to the issues page sorted by oldest (created date ascending).

I can see the issue page. I need to count the total comments. I can see 10 loaded comments so far, and there's a "27 remaining items" button. Let me count the total. The page shows there are items not yet loaded. Let me check the comment count by looking at the page more carefully. I see the page has "27 remaining items" to load, and currently shows about 10 comments. Let me click "Load more" to get the full count, or better - let me use the GitHub API to get the exact comment count.
