That is, strip the path segment from the url? Or is there some more I'm not seeing?\nIn any case, does this means that your recommended usage is:\napp.use('/app', middleware);\napp.route('/app')\n .get(function (req, res) { ... });\n \n \n \n \n \nor\napp.route('/app')\n .all(middleware)\n .get(function (req, res) { ... });\n \n \n \n \n \nDoes the latter make a difference in OPTIONS behavior or something else?👍React with 👍13dch😄React with 😄13dchjonathanong commented on Mar 19, 2014 jonathanongon Mar 19, 2014MemberMore actionsno, app.route() doesn't strip the path segment from the url. only .use() does. up to @defunctzombie if he wants to support this though. it could make the internal code simpler if all middleware used .route() internally, but i'm not sure i see a use-case for this.defunctzombie commented on Mar 19, 2014 defunctzombieon Mar 19, 2014ContributorMore actionsI need to check on the OPTIONS behavior but I would lean towards making sure .all doesn't affect OPTIONS for .route or app.all() but that might break some other assumptions people have made (or backwards compat) so it could be a no-go.\nThe second approach is what I would recommend but it could depend on your reliance on req.path inside the middleware.nakedible commented on Mar 19, 2014 nakedibleon Mar 19, 2014AuthorMore actionsWell, at the very least, when enabling all debugging, using .all will add 24 separate handlers. That doesn't seem reasonable for simply using a middleware.\nThe way I see it is simply that there are three types of handlers on the incoming requests:\n\nHandlers that simply skip requests not matching path prefix\nHandlers that skip requests not matching path prefix and strip prefix from requests matching path prefix\nHandlers that match a certain METHOD and resolve path containing wildcards, params, etc.\n\nThese three types should be usable in all situations.nakedible commented on Mar 19, 2014 nakedibleon Mar 19, 2014AuthorMore actionsYeah, sorry, route() does not strip the path, I confused it with Router - I thought those two were the same thing, with route('/path') just calling app.use('/path', new Router()) and returning the generated instance.defunctzombie commented on Mar 24, 2014 defunctzombieon Mar 24, 2014ContributorMore actionsI think we should change .all to simply add middleware and not affect options responses. Yes, it will be slightly different than app.all, but whatever.jonathanong commented on Mar 26, 2014 jonathanongon Mar 26, 2014MemberMore actions\nI think we should change .all to simply add middleware and not affect options responses.

Then it could strip away any additional path you pass as well.dougwilson commented on Jul 15, 2014 dougwilsonon Jul 15, 2014ContributorMore actions\nRight, the .use would be path after stripping away the route's path.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the route's path is actually a match-to-the-end match, so app.route('/users') would not match /users/1 and such, which seems like a .use() under that would just never match anything to me...defunctzombie commented on Jul 15, 2014 defunctzombieon Jul 15, 2014ContributorMore actionsIt seems that having this feature is useless then?dougwilson commented on Jul 15, 2014 dougwilsonon Jul 15, 2014ContributorMore actions\nIt seems that having this feature is useless then?\n\nRight. So the only use I could come up with was the one above, which would let a user do this:\napp.route('/users')\n.use(bodyParser.json())\n.get(getUsers)\n.post(createUser)\n \n \n \n \n \nand the bodyParser.json middleware would not even be invoked for a PUT /users. It's super easy to implement, but I'm not sure how much of a value it would be. It would basically be the short-hand of doing\napp.route('/users')\n.get(bodyParser.json(), getUsers)\n.post(bodyParser.json(), createUser)\n \n \n \n \n mscdexmentioned this on Jul 17, 2014refactor router #2218nakedibleunassigned defunctzombieon Jul 29, 2014kokujin commented on Aug 6, 2014 kokujinon Aug 6, 2014More actions-1 for \".use()\" in routing.
