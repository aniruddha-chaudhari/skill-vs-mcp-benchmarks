This shows that you can respond to changes in an element's size, even if they have nothing to do with the viewport.\nWe also provide a checkbox to turn the observer off and on. If it is turned off, the text will not change in response to the \u003cdiv\u003e's width changing.\nThe JavaScript looks like so:\n\n \n Observation Errors\n Implementations following the specification invoke resize events before paint (that is, before the frame is presented to the user). If there was any resize event, style and layout are re-evaluated — which in turn may trigger more resize events. Infinite loops from cyclic dependencies are addressed by only processing elements deeper in the DOM during each iteration. Resize events that don't meet that condition are deferred to the next paint, and an error event is fired on the Window object, with the well-defined message string:\nResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.\nNote that this only prevents user-agent lockup, not the infinite loop itself. For example, the following code will cause the width of divElem to grow indefinitely, with the above error message in the console repeating every frame:\n\nAs long as the error event does not fire indefinitely, resize observer will settle and produce a stable, likely correct, layout. However, visitors may see a flash of broken layout, as a sequence of changes expected to happen in a single frame is instead happening over multiple frames.\nIf you want to prevent these errors, the solution depends on what your intended effect is. If you actually intend to have an infinite loop, you just need to defer the resizing code in your ResizeObserver callback to after the browser repaints. You can put it into a requestAnimationFrame callback.\n\nIf you don't intend to have an infinite loop, you should make sure your resizing code does not trigger the resize observer callback. There are many ways to do this, such as by setting an \"expected size\" and not resizing if the size is already at that value.\n\n \n Specifications\n \n \n \n \n Specification\n \n \n \n \n \n Resize Observer# resize-observer-interface\n \n \n \n \n Browser compatibility\n \n \n See also\n \nLearn: The box model\nPerformanceObserver\nIntersectionObserver (part of the Intersection Observer API)\nUpcoming container queries may be a viable alternative for implementing responsive design.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Help improve MDN\n \n \n Learn how to contribute \n This page was last modified on Nov 7, 2025 by MDN contributors.\n \n View this page on GitHub • Report a problem with this content","title":"ResizeObserver - Web APIs | MDN","truncated":false,"url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver"}
