## Assistant

I will help you process the Excel workbook as requested. I'll use the `xlsx` skill to read the data, combine the sections from 'RANGES' into 'LISTS', apply the specified sorting and formatting (including the 'TOTAL' row), and save the result.

First, I'll load the `xlsx` skill and inspect the input file to understand the structure of the 'RANGES' and 'LISTS' sheets.
